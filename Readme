This folder contains the code to fully reproduce all figures and results in the manuscript "Estimating the Number of Clusters via Normalized Cluster Instability";

1) Simulation

Helper_Functions.R: Functions to generate data and to call different clustering methods
submit_all.sh: A bash script that calls submit_jobs.sh with different seeds 1:100
submit_jobs.sh: A bash script that submits a job to the LISA cluster system at the University of Amsterdam, consisting of simulation.R
simulation.R: The simulation script, which is called by submit_jobs.sh with seeds 1:100; each of the 100 runs is additionally parallelized on 6 cores and takes < 2h to compute with 2GHZ on each core.

The script assumes that there is a folder /clusterSim in the HOME directory of a UNIX system, and that this folder contains an output folder: /clusterSim/output.

The simulation can also repeated locally by simply writing a for loop over iter 1:100 in simulation.R. However, if only a single core is available, this can take up to 6 * 2 * 100 hours.

The output folder in the reproducibility archive contains the output of this simulation.
